Backup-Since all the participants<?='&#39;'?> documents are duplicated many times over TradeFinex blockchain, they always enjoy free backup. Safety-Cryptography (the technology of encrypting websites) ensures TradeFinex is never hacked and therefore, participants are safe in every aspect. Speed-Since smart contracts deploy a software code to automate tasks, participants save hours of time that would otherwise go towards manually processing all paperwork. Savings-Since there is no intermediary or third party, participants save big on fees paid to notary and more. Accuracy-Since everything is done digitally, the possibility of human error is automatically ruled out, hence the accuracy. </div>

Backup-Since all the participants<?='&#39;'?> documents are duplicated many times over TradeFinex blockchain, they always enjoy free backup. Safety-Cryptography (the technology of encrypting websites) ensures TradeFinex is never hacked and therefore, participants are safe in every aspect. Speed-Since smart contracts deploy a software code to automate tasks, participants save hours of time that would otherwise go towards manually processing all paperwork. Savings-Since there is no intermediary or third party, participants save big on fees paid to notary and more. Accuracy-Since everything is done digitally, the possibility of human error is automatically ruled out, hence the accuracy.

Upon reaching an agreement, each party using their cryptographic key, unique to them can sign off on the contract. The cryptographic key would be either a "symbol or process attached to or logically linked with a record" and the deliberate signing off will demonstrate each party<?='&#39;'?>s "intent to sign the record". Irrespective of the specific contract terms between the parties, the fact that a blockchain-based smart contract can require the participants to sign the contract through the cryptographic key should ensure them that smart contracts created over TradeFinex blockchain are legally binding contracts.
