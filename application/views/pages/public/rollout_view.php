TradeFinex will work purely as an aggregator for Trade Assets. The initial partners will be TradeShift (A USD 1.1 Billion company), Fineon Exchange (European suppliers focused distribution platforms connected with over 45 banks)</li>
                                <li>We are still awaiting to integrate with Voltron (R3 Corda) and Komgo (Hyperledger Besu). Both these platforms have a good origination network with a consortium and banks and TradeFinex aims to connect them using its middleware built on XDC protocol to aggregate data from various origination platforms for secondary market trades</li>
