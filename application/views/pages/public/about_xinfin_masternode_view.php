                <p>XinFin's token XDC supplants proof-of-work consensus algorithm (popularly linked with mining) with proof-of-stake consensus algorithm, fundamentally using the concept of "validators".</p>
                <p>Validators are special nodes used in the XDPoS consensus algorithm which validate each transaction occurring on the blockchain network. The result of this validation is to finally append the transaction on the blockchain. A transaction may be accepted by the validator or rejected. (<strong>Important:</strong> There can be multiple validator nodes in each network.) </p>
                <p>Decisions made by these validator nodes are broadcasted through the network as messages which are signed (attested) using validated cryptographic public key. Every validator node running XDC protocol in the RCL network is responsible for deciding its Unique Node List (UNL). This list holds information about which regular nodes does the validator care about.</p>
                <p><strong>To set up a masternode, make sure your XDC protocol running node is publicly identified and has gone through the compliance process. Every Node Holder need to upload KYC document and this detail will be visible to the public network.</strong></p>
                <p class="tf-sub-header mb-20">Why set up a masternode at all?</p>
                <p>It is necessary to set up a masternode to operate on XDC protocol because masternodes make the decentralised blockchain network self-sustainable. Deploying masternode is conducive to trusted, scalable decentralised network infrastructure. Such an environment facilitates greater stability and reliability on the network.</p>
                <p class="tf-sub-header mb-20">Functions of masternode</p>
                <p>In XDPoS blockchain environment, masternode concept is cardinal to the functioning. A masternode validates each (or segment of transaction depending upon UNL) transaction and is also responsible for writing the transaction onto the truth ledger: the blockchain. As a consequence, this makes decentralised governance of the network possible.</p>
                <p class="tf-sub-header mb-20">Restrictions on nodes which aspire to become masternodes</p>
                <p class="mt-10 mb-5">Nodes which possess any of the below mentioned characteristics may not qualify to become masternodes:</p>
                <div class="bulletList">
                    <ul>
                        <li>Anonymous entity on the network.</li>
                        <li>Intentions to fork XDC Software.</li>
                        <li>Entity or Individual with Criminal record in past.</li>
                        <li>Entity or Individual which does not comply with local law of land.</li>

                <p class="mt-10 mb-5">Several reasons why setting up a masternode is useful are:</p>
                <div class="bulletList">
                    <ul class="mb-2">
                        <li>Reputation building within the network community.</li>
                        <li>Trust Factor enhances for your node particularly since network relies on your node.</li>
                        <li>More Incentive gain as your node pushes more transactions on network.</li>
                        <li>Private blockchain is capable of running its own use case.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>
                <p class="mt-10 mb-5"><strong>Important:</strong> Max number of Master node allowed in the network is 5000.</p>
                <p class="mt-10 mb-5"><strong>Special incentives for 18th validator node:</strong> Information required Depends on No's of Block created by validator node (incentive In terms of XDC)</p>

                <p>This guide will demonstrate how to set up a single masternode for the very first time. You will need the following before starting:</p>
                <div class="orderList">
                    <ol>
                        <li> At least 10,000,000 XDC with masternode holder to perform proof-of-stake consensus seamlessly.</li>
                        <li> Wallet to store XDC tokens, preferably hardware.</li>
                        <li> Dedicated and stable hardware environment.</li>
                        <li> Dedicated Static Public IP address.</li>
                        <li> 100% network uptime by IDC network.</li>
                        <li> Minimum tier 3+ IDC environment.</li>
                        <li> (Optional, but highly recommended) Virtual Private Server (VPS).</li>
                        <li> For cloud based services, Amazon EC2's m3.large VM size would be appropriate. Similar configuration is applicable for Microsoft Azure Cloud network.</li>

                <p>In XinFin, there are two networks where you can run XDC protocol: the mainnet and the testnet.</p>
                <p>The mainnet is used to transact real XDC. The XDC's value is tied to real fiat currency via cryptocurrency exchanges.</p>
                <p>As developers, you do not want to run application tests with real money. That is what the testnet is for. We call the testnet <a href="http://xinfin.network/" target="_blank">XinFinTestNet</a>.</p>
